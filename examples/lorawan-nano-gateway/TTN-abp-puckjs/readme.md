Connect the puck-js puck to TTN via the LoPy

Upload the Send_BT_to_LoPy.js script to the puck-js

The other files go unto the LoPy

Make sure to edit the lib\config.py


** UUID **
A bit more info on the use of the UUID used by the Lopy was provided by Jose at the Pycom forum, here:
https://forum.pycom.io/topic/1004/connect-the-puck-js-to-the-things-network-using-a-pycom-lopy/2
So, as a general advise it is better to generate your own UUID's if you want your services to be mistaken for the ones created by others.
